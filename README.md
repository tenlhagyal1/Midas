## Wireframe 

1. Landing Page
2. Register Page
3. Login Page

## Motivation

We wanted to test our skills and build a application that would challenge us. We also wanted to build an application that would be useful to us and others.

## How to Use

Login to the webpage / create an account. 
A list of stocks should be displayed to the user on the home page.
A paper trade balance should be displayed to the user if they click the trading tab. 
With this they can Buy & Sell stocks.

Enjoy Trading!
